## Project aims

Electrical systems in industrial and commercial settings are relying more on sensitive electronics that are vulnerable to Transient Voltage events also referred to as electrical surges. Transient voltage events are short bursts of high electrical energy that can interfere with or damage systems, mainly caused by power switching, wiring faults, and external events like lightning strikes. When subjected to these electrical surges, sensitive electronics can fail or suffer permanent damage, causing loss of data, damage to expensive equipment, and a potential safety risk to users. 
Existing SPDs are primarily designed to limit the transient energy from reaching the system by diverting the energy away from the sensitive electronics. However, SPDs have a finite lifespan and over time their protection threshold can deteriorate allowing transient energy through and damaging the system. The lack of knowledge on SPDs, combined with the current methods not always being effective to protect the evolving electronics needed in industry and commercial use, highlights the importance of SPD improvement.
This project is based on an issue I encountered while I was on industrial placement. A company control panel was struck by lightning, causing damage to several electrical components. This highlights the importance of surge protection devices in real industrial environments and emphasises the need for improved surge protection methods as electronic systems continue to evolve.

## Conclusion

The project achieved the main objectives that were outlined at the start of the report. Research into existing surge protection methods helped identify the main design requirements needed to develop a similar protection circuit. Using this information, a circuit was designed using CAD software, simulated to check its behaviour, and then built and tested in the laboratory. The testing showed that the comparator was able to detect when the input voltage exceeded the reference voltage, while the MOSFET and relay switching stage disconnected the protected circuit during these conditions. The laboratory testing also showed behaviour that was very similar to what was observed in the simulation. Overall, the project shows that a simple and low-cost design can provide effective protection, with scope for further improvements and real-world use.
The proposed circuit also shows potential for use in commercial and industrial applications, particularly in systems where sensitive electronics require protection from transient events. Compared to traditional surge protection devices, which often rely on passive components such as MOVs that degrade over time. The developed circuit introduces an active approach by monitoring voltage levels and disconnecting the load when a threshold is exceeded. This provides an additional layer of protection, reducing the risk of component failure under repeated surge conditions. While the current design is implemented at a low-voltage level, the concept could be further developed and scaled for higher voltage systems, making it suitable for integration into control panels and other industrial machines where improved surge protection is required.

## Future Improvements

- The trigger circuit could be improved to create a more stable waveform, allowing the protection circuit to switch more clearly, to then improve on the protection circuit further.
- The response time of the circuit could be improved by replacing the relay with faster switching components such as solid-state devices or faster transistors, allowing the circuit to react more quickly to transient voltage spikes.
- The prototype was tested using low-voltage laboratory equipment, so future work could involve scaling the design to operate with higher voltage systems such as mains to better represent real industrial conditions.
- An additional LED indicator could be added on the protected side of the circuit to provide a visual indication when a surge event has occurred.
- The circuit could be further developed for use in specific environments listed in this report such as data centres or telecommunication where protection of sensitive electronics is required.
